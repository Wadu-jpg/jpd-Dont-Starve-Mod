# jpd-Dont-Starve-Mod
Horrible Mod. However, all the code is simplified down so that anyone can replace the character and items to whatever they want

This works more as a default character or sample charater. This is a fork of a Custom Character mod I found on Steam, but that one was horribly outdated.
Changed a few things and now you simply have to change the name of the files to your characters name.
Default name is Kariya
